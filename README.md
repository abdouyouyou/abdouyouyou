- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on **a project that automates the treatment of some excel files thus automating the synthesis of said data and reducing the decision taking time, this project is in python, i am also currently working on some data analysis workbooks.My man work is my Master theisis which consists on implementing a dimentionality reduction in data stream clustering using the river api in python, i have translated the algorithm that was written in java to python (due to the river api having so many fucntionalities already implemented) and now currently trying to get the dimentionality reduction done aswell.**
- I have many modest projects under my belt i'll list some:
- i wrote a multimedia player in java with a gui using swing, i had implemented teh ability to load a single file and then add many to a queue or load a playlist already, with a pause and play button and progress bar that handled the forwarding.
- i wrote a crud system in c using file pointers,we had to write a file that contains informations about a workers that are inputted through a cli menu, the informations were stored in a struct that was written into a bin file as bytes and read as bytes aswell.
- i wrote some sdl code bakc in the day, it was really a bunch of mini projects,a program where different images where shown according to a press of a button, and so on
- i wrote a java program with a simple gui that automates a certain specific treatment of an excel bank statement, that not only normalizes the data but formats the cells correctly (which unfortunately the bank doesn't do) but also adds multiple columns that help decision making, this project was done to help a financial consultant be more efficient with his and his clients time, the excel integration was done using the apache poi api.
- i wrote a python app using pyqt for a gui api that helps organize the payments received by a cashier by bills (we are talking big amounts) where basically the client coming in already declares a certain amount and then the cashier counts them stack by stack and enters the type of bills and the number of bills in each stack thus helping them make sure that the declared amount is equal to the counted amount, i used pandas to store the details of the history of the operations and wrote them to a pqrauet file.
- i have written a small websites that generates random dj khaled quotes that displays the image and the plays the sound byte of the quote in react js.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **Data stream clustering which is my masters thesis, and reading about data analysis, also revisiting c++ which is a great language and the most fun i have while programming, the closeness to the machine that c/c++ gives you will always be unmatched.**
